- **Accessibility:** ARIA roles and attributes are implemented for screen-reader compatibility.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for seamless display on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Interactive States:** Visual feedback for hover and focus states with smooth transitions.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For the structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** For interactive functionality.
