# Unique Character Count

This project includes a Python function that counts the frequency of unique characters in a given string. The function is optimized for large inputs.

## Features

- **Accurate Character Counting**: Handles both lowercase and uppercase letters.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Processes large strings efficiently using a dictionary.
- **Simple Input/Output**: Easy-to-use function that accepts a string and returns a dictionary of character frequencies.

## Example

### Input
```python
"characteristics"
```

### Output
```python
 {'c': 3, 'h': 1, 'a': 2, 'r': 2, 't': 2, 'e': 1, 'i': 2, 's': 2}
```

## Big-O Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(u)`, where `u` is the number of unique characters in the string.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/unique-character-count.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python unique_character_count.py
   ```


# FAQ Accordion Component

## Project Description
The FAQ Accordion Component is a responsive and accessible accordion feature for displaying frequently asked questions (FAQs). It allows users to toggle the visibility of answers by clicking on the questions. This project is designed with user experience and accessibility in mind, ensuring smooth navigation across devices and compatibility with assistive technologies.

## Features
- **Accordion Behavior:** Only one FAQ answer is visible at a time.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Users can navigate and toggle FAQs using the `Tab`, `Enter`, or `Space` keys.
- **Accessibility:** ARIA roles and attributes are implemented for screen-reader compatibility.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for seamless display on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Interactive States:** Visual feedback for hover and focus states with smooth transitions.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For the structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** For interactive functionality.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
 
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd faq-accordion
   ```
3. Open the `FAQ Accordion.html` file in your preferred browser.

## Usage
1. Click on a question to view the corresponding answer.
2. Use `Tab` to navigate through the questions and `Enter` or `Space` to toggle visibility.

## File Structure
```
faq-accordion/
├── FAQ Acordion.html       # Main HTML file
├── styles.css       # CSS styles for layout and design

```

## Accessibility Features
- ARIA roles and attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`) ensure compatibility with screen readers.
- Keyboard navigation allows toggling and focus management without using a mouse.
- Focus and hover states provide clear visual indicators.

## Responsive Behavior
- On mobile devices, FAQ items stack vertically for better readability.
- On larger screens, the component adjusts to utilize available space.
- Smooth transitions enhance user experience across all devices.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding animation customizations for more visually appealing transitions.
- Incorporating themes or dark mode for better user preferences.
- Extending functionality to allow multiple answers to be visible simultaneously if needed.
